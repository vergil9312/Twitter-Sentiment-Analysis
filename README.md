# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This project imports tweets with positive or negative labels. Then it preprocesses them so that the tweets are more ready for classification algorithms. Then we used Naive Bayes, support vector machine, multinomial logistic regression to train and classify the tweets into positive or negative sentiment. We also used ensembled classifiers which were built using an "AND" or "OR" operation of any of the three claissifers above. We drew plots that showed the performance of each method using different training size.
